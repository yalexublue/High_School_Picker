## Student

A student is a user that is actively looking for a High School to apply for. Students are able to use Shortlist to:

1. View personalized recommendations of High Schools (based on their own prior choices)
2. Rate High Schools (**where did this come from?**)
3. Categorize recommended High Schools as "rejected," "shortlist1," "shortlist2," "shortlist3"
4. Manage the contents of, and the names/look/feel of, each of these lists
5. Share lists with 3rd parties

## School Staff
